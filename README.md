# README

I'm creating this because I really enjoy light themes, but apparently dark theme is trending for a long time and I really love the Dracula theme, so I'm creating my own, named Alucard to be the opposite of it

## This is the README for your extension "alucard-theme"

You can author your README using Visual Studio Code. Here are some useful editor keyboard shortcuts:

- Split the editor (`Cmd+\` on macOS or `Ctrl+\` on Windows and Linux)
- Toggle preview (`Shift+CMD+V` on macOS or `Shift+Ctrl+V` on Windows and Linux)
- Press `Ctrl+Space` (Windows, Linux) or `Cmd+Space` (macOS) to see a list of Markdown snippets

**Enjoy!**
